# CW Decoder
CW decoder using a PIC microcontroller

This is a CW decoder using a PIC(16F88) microcontroller, based on [WD7FHC's
Arduino decoder](http://www.mypetarduino.com/ReadCode/readCode.01.html).

The code has been improved: it is much more flexible with different display
sizes and supports displays with multiple controller chips (using my [HD44780
library](https://github.com/camilstaps/hd44780_pic)).

For a schematic, see [PA3GER's page](http://www.pa3ger.nl/zelfbouw/cw-decoder/)
(Dutch, but the
[schematic](http://www.pa3ger.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CW-decoder.pdf) is
in English). Simply replace the Arduino with a PIC(16F88).
